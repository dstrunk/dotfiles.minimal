Minimal dotfiles

This repo is for non home-related dev setups. My personal dotfiles has grown to
include several different programming languages, Homebrew Casks from programs
that require licenses, etc.

This repo is more minimal; only Zsh, my terminal config, git setup, and bash
aliases come along for the ride. Oh, some Homebrew stuff can come, too.

For more information on my (now out-of-date) dotfiles, see
